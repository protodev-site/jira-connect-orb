  This Orb is almost identical to circleci/jira, but adds the possibility to pass a commit message subject and body through parameters.

  This Orb reports the status of builds and deployments in CircleCI Projects to your Jira Cloud instance.

  Requires that [CircleCI for Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1215946) be installed in the Jira *Cloud* instance.

  Please see [CircleCI Jira integration docs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/jira-plugin/)
